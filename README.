# Instructions

This is an Interface that allows you to immutably store documents on the IPFS network.

You must first create an IPFS Gateway.

>install IPFS from pre-build package

In working directory
$ipfs init
Check working
$ipfs help
Start daemon
$ipfs daemon

## Deal with Editor var bullshit

Find your editor e.g. nano

$which nano
->/bin/nano
Set ENV
$export EDITOR="/bin/nano/"
$echo $EDITOR
$./bin/nano

## Deal with CORS bullshit

$ipfs config edit

Make sure this is set like so:

(....)
  "API": {
    "HTTPHeaders": {
      "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": [
        "PUT",
        "GET",
        "POST"
      ],
      "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  }
(.....)

Restart daemon
$ipfs daemon

## Run App

$npm start

Check out localhost:3000

Make sure IFPS is doing its thang on :5001

Upload file and watch the magic happen! You should get an IPFS hash back

## Debug

If the app doesn't work you can use dirty.html for a quickstart via CDN
